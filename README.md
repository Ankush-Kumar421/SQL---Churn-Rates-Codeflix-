# SQL---Churn-Rates-Codeflix-
This project is part of Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I calculated and analyzed churn rates for a startup called Codeflix. There are three files:

  1) Powerpoint presentation - My analysis being communicated to the audience.
  2) The excel file - My detail analysis in tables and graphs forms.
  3) The SQL file - My queries used in generating the data to be analyzed. The actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the    queries. Originally the queries were created using .SQLite format but I converted it to .sql format. The file can be opened with Sublime Text.
