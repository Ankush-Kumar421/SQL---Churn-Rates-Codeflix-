# SQL---Churn-Rates-Codeflix-
This project is part of Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I calculated and analyzed churn rates for a startup called Codeflix. There are three files:

Powerpoint presentation - My analysis being communicated to the audience.
The excel file - My detail analysis in tables and graphs forms.
The SQL file - My queries used in generating the data to be analyzed. The actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the queries. This file is .SQLite but can be saved as .sql and opened with Sublime Text.
